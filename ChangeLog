	* lib/Astro/FITS/HdrTrans/Base.pm (can_translate): Support regular
	expression in this_instrument() method. This allows IRCAM to match
	IRCAM and IRCAM3.

2005-04-05  Tim Jenness  <timj@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* All modules: Major rewriting of the internals to use inheritance
	and method importing. This leads to much smaller individual
	translation classes and hopefully will be easier to support with
	less duplication of code. Note that the public function interface
	is unchanged but the public access to variables has been removed
	(and replaced with some class methods).

	* Add GPL to all files

	* HdrTrans/CGS4.pm: Header keywords for telescope offsets were changed
	from RAOFF/DECOFF to TRAOFF/TDECOFF, so change the translation code
	to reflect this.
