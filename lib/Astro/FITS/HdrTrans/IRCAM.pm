Astro::FITS::HdrTrans::IRCAM - UKIRT IRCAM translations

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Astro::FITS::HdrTrans::IRCAM;

  %gen = Astro::FITS::HdrTrans::IRCAM->translate_from_FITS( %hdr );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides a generic set of translations that are specific
to the IRCAM camera of the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope.

# Note that header merging fails with IRCAM in some cases because
# some items are duplicated in the .HEADER and .I1 but using different

# same header. It is arguably an error that Astro::FITS::Header looks

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item B<this_instrument>

The name of the instrument required to match (case insensitively)
against the INSTRUME/INSTRUMENT keyword to allow this class to
translate the specified headers. Called by the default
C<can_translate> method.

  $inst = $class->this_instrument();

Returns a pattern match for /^IRCAM\d?/".

  return qr/^IRCAM\d?/i;

=head1 COMPLEX CONVERSIONS

=over 4

=item B<to_DEC_SCALE>

Pixel scale along the Declination axis in arcseconds.  If the pixel
scale is not defined in the PIXELSIZ or CDELT2 headers, then default
to 0.08144 arcseconds for data taken after 19990901, or 0.286
arcseconds for older data.  The value will always be positive.

  # measured in degrees (but protect against cases where it may have been in

=item B<from_DEC_SCALE>

Generate the PIXELSIZ or CDELT2 header for IRCAM2 or IRCAM3 data
respectively.  The header will be returned in arcseconds, and will 
always be positive.

Checks the filter name.

=item B<to_RA_SCALE>

Returns the pixel scale along the RA axis in arcseconds.  If the pixel
scale is not defined in the PIXELSIZ or CDELT1 headers, then default
to -0.08144 arcseconds for data taken after 19990901, or -0.286
arcseconds for older data.  The value will always be negative.

Generates the PIXELSIZ or CDELT1 header for IRCAM2 or IRCAM3 data
respectively.  The header will be returned in arcseconds, and will 
always be negative.

=item B<to_SPEED_GAIN>

For data taken before 22 November 2000, the SPD_GAIN header was not
written.  Obtain the SPEED_GAIN from the detector bias if the SPD_GAIN
header is not defined.  If the detector bias is between 0.61 and 0.63,
then the SPEED_GAIN is Standard.  Otherwise, it is Deepwell.

=item B<from_SPEED_GAIN>

Translates the SPEED_GAIN generic header into the SPD_GAIN
IRCAM-specific header.  Note that this will break bi-directional tests
as the SPD_GAIN header did not exist in data taken before 2000
November 22.

For data taken before 20000607, return 'UKIRT, Mauna Kea, HI'. For
data taken on and after 20000607, return
'UKIRT,Mauna_Kea,HI'. Returned header is C<TELESCOP>.

Specify the reference pixel, which is normally near the frame centre.
Note that offsets for polarimetry are undefined.

Returns CRPIX1.

  my $self = shift;
  my $generic_headers = shift;
  return ( "CRPIX1", $generic_headers->{"X_REFERENCE_PIXEL"} );

=item B<to_Y_REFERENCE_PIXEL>

Specify the reference pixel, which is normally near the frame centre.
Note that offsets for polarimetry are undefined.

Returns CRPIX2.

=item B<to_ROTATION>

Returns fixed rotation values based on the UT date.
