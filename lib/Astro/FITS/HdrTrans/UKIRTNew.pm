=head1 NAME

Astro::FITS::HdrTrans::UKIRTNew - Base class for translation of new UKIRT instruments

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Astro::FITS::HdrTrans::UKIRTNew;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides a generic set of translations that are common to
the newer generation of instruments from the United Kingdom Infrared
Telescope.  This includes MICHELLE, UIST, UFTI and WFCAM. It should
not be used directly for translation of instrument FITS headers.

# For a constant mapping, there is no FITS header, just a generic
# header that is constant.
my %CONST_MAP = (

                );

# Unit mapping implies that the value propogates directly
# to the output with only a keyword name change.
my %UNIT_MAP = (
                DEC_TELESCOPE_OFFSET => "TDECOFF",
                DR_RECIPE            => "RECIPE",
                EXPOSURE_TIME        => "EXP_TIME",
                GAIN                 => "GAIN",
                RA_TELESCOPE_OFFSET  => "TRAOFF",
                UTDATE               => "UTDATE",

=head1 COMPLEX CONVERSIONS

These methods are more complicated than a simple mapping.  We have to
provide both from- and to-FITS conversions.  All these routines are
methods and the to_ routines all take a reference to a hash and return
the translated value (a many-to-one mapping).  The from_ methods take
a reference to a generic hash and return a translated hash (sometimes
these are many-to-many).
