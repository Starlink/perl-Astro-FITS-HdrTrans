=head1 NAME

Astro::FITS::HdrTrans::Base - Base class for header translation

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use base qw/ Astro::FITS::HdrTrans::Base /;

  %generic = Astro::FITS::HdrTrans::Base->translate_from_FITS( \%fits );
  %fits = Astro::FITS::HdrTrans::Base->translate_to_FITS( \%gen );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the header translation base class. Not to be confused with
C<Astro::FITS::HdrTrans> itself, which is a high level abstraction
class. In general users should use C<Astro::FITS::HdrTrans>
for initiating header translations unless they know what they are
doing. Also C<Astro::FITS::HdrTrans> is the only public interface
to the header translation.

=item B<translate_from_FITS>

Do the header translation from FITS for the specified class.

  %generic = $class->translate_to_FITS( \%fitshdr,
                                        prefix => $prefix,
                                        frameset => $wcs,
                                     );

Prefix is attached to the keys in the returned hash if it
is defined. The frameset is an optional Starlink::AST object.

If a translation results in an undefined value (for example, if the
headers can represent both imaging and spectroscopy there may be no
requirement for a DISPERSION header), the result is not stored in the
translated hash.

A list of failed translations is available in the _UNDEFINED_TRANSLATIONS
key in the generic hash. This points to a reference to an array of all
the failed generic translations.

The class used for the translation is stored in the key _TRANSLATION_CLASS.
This can then be used to reverse the translation without having to
re-scan the headers.

=head1 PROTECTED METHODS

These methods are available to translation subclasses and should
not be used by external classes.

=over 4

=item B<can_translate>

Returns true if the supplied headers can be handled by this class.

  $cando = $class->can_translate( \%hdrs );

The base class version of this method returns true if either the C<INSTRUME>
or C<INSTRUMENT> key exist and match the value returned by the
C<this_instrument> method. Comparisons are case-insensitive and can use
regular expressions on instrument name if provided by the base class.


=cut

sub can_translate {
  my $class = shift;
  my $headers = shift;

  # get the reference instrument string
  my $ref = $class->this_instrument();
  return 0 unless defined $ref;

  # For consistency in subsequent algorithm convert
  # a string to a pattern match object
  if (not ref($ref)) { 
    $ref = quotemeta($ref);
    $ref = qr/^$ref$/i;
  }

  # check against the FITS and Generic versions.
  my $inst;
  for my $k (qw/ INSTRUME INSTRUMENT /) {
    if (exists $headers->{$k} && defined $headers->{$k}) {
      $inst = $headers->{$k};
      last;
    }
  }

  # no recognizable instrument
  return 0 unless defined $inst;

  # Now do the test
  return ( $inst =~ $ref );
}

=item B<this_instrument>

Name of the instrument that can be translated by this class.
Defaults to an empty string. The method must be subclassed.

 $inst = $class->this_instrument();

Can return a regular expresion object (C<qr>).

=cut

sub this_instrument {
  return "";
}

=item B<valid_class>

Historically this method was used to determine whether this class can
handle the supplied FITS headers.  The headers can be either in
generic form or in FITS form.

  $isvalid = $class->valid_class( \%fits );

The base class always returns false. This is a backwards compatibility
method to prevent mixing of translation modules from earlier release
of C<Astro::FITS::HdrTrans> with the current object-oriented version.
See the C<can_translate> method for the new interface.

=cut

sub valid_class {
  return 0;
}

=item B<_generate_lookup_methods>

We generate the unit and constant mapping methods automatically from a
lookup table.

  Astro::FITS::HdrTrans::UKIRT->_generate_lookup_methods( \%const, \%unit);

This method generates all the simple internal methods. Expects two arguments,
both references to hashes. The first is a reference to a hash with
constant mapping from FITS to generic (and no reverse mapping), the
second is a reference to a hash with unit mappings (both from and to
methods are created). The methods are placed into the package given
by the class supplied to the method.

  Astro::FITS::HdrTrans::UKIRT->_generate_lookup_methods( \%const, \%unit, \%null);

Additionally, an optional third argument can be used to indicate
methods that should be null translations. This is a reference to an array
of generic keywords and should be used in the rare cases when a base
class implementation should be nullified. This will result in undefined
values in the generic hash but no value in the generic to FITS mapping.

A fourth optional argument can specify those unit mappings that should
use the final entry in a subheader (if a subheader is present). Mainly
associated with END events such as AIRMASS_END or ELEVATION_END.

  Astro::FITS::HdrTrans::UKIRT->_generate_lookup_methods( \%const, \%unit,
                                                          \%null, \%endobs);

These methods will have the standard interface of

  $generic = $class->_to_GENERIC_NAME( \%fits );
  %fits = $class->_from_GENERIC_NAME( \%generic );

Generic unit map translations use the via_subheader() method in scalar
context and so will retrieve the first sub header value if the keyword
is not present in the primary header.

=head1 PROTECTED IMPORTS

Not all translation methods warrant a full blown inheritance.  For
cases where one or two translation routines should be imported
(e.g. reading DATE-OBS FITS standard headers without importing the
additional FITS methods) a special import routine can be used when
using the class.

  use Astro::FITS::HdrTrans::FITS qw/ ROTATION /;

This will load the from_ROTATION and to_ROTATION methods into
the namespace.

=cut

sub import {
  my $class = shift;

  # this is where we are going to install the methods
  my $callpkg = caller();

  # Prepend the from_ and to_ prefixes
  for my $key (@_) {
    # The key can be fully specified with from_ and to_ already
    # In that case we do not want to loop over from_ and to_
    my @directions = qw/ from_ to_ /;
    if ($key =~ /^from_/ || $key =~ /^to_/) {
      @directions = ( '' );     # empty prefix
    }

    for my $dir (@directions) {
      my $method = $dir . $key;
      #print "Importing method $method\n";
      no strict 'refs';

      if (!defined *{"$class\::$method"}) {
        croak "Method $method is not available for export from class $class";
      }

      # assign it
      *{"$callpkg\::$method"} = \&{"$class\::$method"};
    }
  }

}

=head1 WRITING A TRANSLATION CLASS

In order to create a translation class for a new instrument it is
first necessary to work out the different types of translations that
are required; whether they are unit mappings (a simple change of
keyword but no change in value), constant mappings (a constant is
returned independently of the FITS header), mappings that already
exist in another class or complex mappings that have to be explicitly
coded.

All translation classes must ultimately inherit from
C<Astro::FITS::HdrTrans::Base>.

The first step in creation of a class is to handle the "can this class
translate the supplied headers" query that will be requested from
the C<Astro::FITS::HdrTrans> package. If the instrument name is present
in the standard "INSTRUME" FITS header then this can be achieved simply
by writing a C<this_instrument> method in the subclass that will return
the name of the instrument that can be translated. If a more complex
decision is required it will be necessary to subclass the C<can_translate>
method. This takes the headers that are to be translated (either in FITS
or generic form since the method is queried for either direction) and
returns a boolean indicating whether the class can be used.

Once the class can declare it's translation instrument the next
step is to write the actual translation methods themselves. If any
unit- or constant-mappings are required they can be setup by defining
the %UNIT_MAP and %CONST_MAP (the names are unimportant) hashes
and calling the base class automated method constructor:

  __PACKAGE__->_generate_lookup_methods( \%CONST_MAP, \%UNIT_MAP );

If your translations are very similar to an existing set of translations
you can inherit from that class instead of C<Astro::FITS::HdrTrans::Base>.
Multiple inheritance is supported if, for example, you need to
inherit from both the standard FITS translations (eg for DATE-OBS
processing) and from a more telescope-specific set of translations.

If inheritance causes some erroneous mappings to leak through it is
possible to disable a specific mapping by specifying a @NULL_MAP
array to the method generation. This is an array of generic keywords.

  __PACKAGE__->_generate_lookup_methods( \%CONST_MAP, \%UNIT_MAP,
                                         \@NULL_MAP );

If a subset of translation methods are required from another class
but there is no desire to inherit the full set of methods then it
is possible to import specific translation methods from other classes.

  use Astro::FITS::HdrTrans::FITS qw/ UTSTART UTEND /;

would import just the DATE-OBS and DATE-END handling functions from
the FITS class. Note that both the from- and to- translations will
be imported.

At some point you may want to write your own more complex translations.
To do this you must write to- and from- methods. The API for all
the from_FITS translations is identical:

  $translation = $class->to_GENERIC_KEYWORD( \%fits_headers );

ie given a reference to a hash of FITS headers (which can be
a tied C<Astro::FITS::Header> object), return a scalar value which
is the translated value.

To convert from generic to FITS the interface is:

  %fits_subset = $class->from_GENERIC_KEYWORD( \%generic_header );

ie multiple FITS keywords and values can be returned since in some
cases a single generic keyword is obtained by combining information
from multiple FITS headers.

Finally, if this translation module is to be part of the
C<Astro::FITS::HdrTrans> distribution the default list of translation
classes must be updated in C<Astro::FITS::HdrTrans>. If this is to be
a runtime plugin, then the list of classes can be expanded at
runtime. For example, it should be possible for
C<Astro::FITS::HdrTrans::MyNewInst> to automatically append itself to
the list of known classes if the module is explicitly loaded by the
user (rather than dynamically loaded to test the headers).

Some generic keywords actually return scalar objects. Any new instruments
must consistently return compatible objects. For example, UTDATE,
UTSTART and UTEND return (currently) Time::Piece objects.
