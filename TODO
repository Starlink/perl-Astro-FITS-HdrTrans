 - Take advantage of classes other than Time::Piece for generic
   headers (Astro::Telescope for telescope information, Astro::Coords
   for coordinates, etc).

 - Add appropriate headers for other areas of astronomy. Currently
   the headers have a bias towards infrared and submillimeter.

 - Take Astro::FITS::Header object when doing translation.
